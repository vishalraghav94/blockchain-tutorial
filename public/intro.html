        This tutorial aims to provide the reader with a basic understanding of <b>Blockchain Technology</b> and <b>Decentralised Apps</b>.
        This tutorial consist of step by step understanding of,
        how to create a decentralised app using in-memory blockchain and aims to extend to the real <b>Ethereum Blockchain</b>.<br>

    <div class="topic-detail">
        You will find definition of Blockchain on internet very easily, so I will not go into that, instead I highly recommend you to watch the video first.
        The video clearly explain basic of Blockchain, thanks to Mr. Shai Rubin for creating such an awesome video.
        <div class="video">

        </div>
        <div>
            Now, that you got the idea of Blockchain (Assuming that you’ve watched the video),
            you should be able to answer these questions, and if you are not then watch it again :
            <ul class="list">
                <li class="list-item">
                    One transaction happens and will get recorded into the ledger,but how will that transactions be validated and who will do that ?
                </li>
                <li class="list-item">
                    Lets say you’ve $1 and you sent it to someone and before it is getting validated and added to the ledger by miner, you did another transaction with that $1 (i.e. Double spending problem), then what will happen?
                </li>
                <li class="list-item">
                    Miners do validation of transaction — but what is validation and what does it means?
                </li>

            </ul>

    <div class="topic-name">See blockchain in action</div>
    <div class="topic-detail">
        So now once you got the idea about Blockchain, don’t you want to see it in action?
        Here is one video created by Mr. Anders, which is a visual introduction to the concepts behind a Blockchain.
